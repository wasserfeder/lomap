## Installation Instructions

Linux (Ubuntu)
1. Clone the _lomap_ repository
  * Navigate to desired location
  * Run the following line in shell:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/wasserfeder/lomap.git
  ```

2. Install _Spot_ using Debian Packages (https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/install.html)
  * Run the following lines in shell:

    ```
    wget -q -O - https://www.lrde.epita.fr/repo/debian.gpg | apt-key add -
    echo 'deb http://www.lrde.epita.fr/repo/debian/ stable/' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
    apt-get update
    apt-get install spot libspot-dev spot-doc python3-spot # Or a subset of those
    ```

3. Install necessary dependencies:

  * Run the following lines in shell:

    ```bash
    apt install python-pip
    pip install six
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install numpy
    apt-get install python-tk
    pip install networkx==1.11
    pip install pyyaml
    pip install pp
    apt install cmake
    ```

  * Note: Ensure that Python 2.7 is installed.
  * Note: If Python3, install matplotlib==2.2.3 in order to maintain compatibility with network 1.11

4. Download and unpack _ltl2dstar_
  * Download from: https://www.ltl2dstar.de/
  * Unpack _ltl2dstar_
  * Navigate to the _ltl2dstar_ folder
  * Run the following lines in shell:

      ```bash
      mkdir build
      cd build/
      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src
      make
      ```

  * Optionally add the binary to folder in `PATH`
    * For example:

      ```bash
      mkdir ~/bin
      cp ltl2dstar ~/bin/
      echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
      ```

5. Set `$PYTHONPATH` to include the location of the _lomap_ library:
  * Run the following line in shell:

      ```bash
      export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/lomap"
      ```

  * Optionally make this setting persistent:

      ```bash
      echo 'export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/lomap"' >> ~/.bashrc
      ```

6. Test if the setup worked properly:
  * Navigate to `/lomap/lomap/tests`
  * Run any of the Python test files
    * Ex. `python test_automata.py`

### Common Issues:
1. ```python
      ImportError: No module named lomap.classes
   ```
  * Problem: The _lomap_ library is not in the path variable
  * Possible Solution: Manually add _lomap_ to your Python directory

2. ```python
      File "/usr/bin/pip", line 9, in <module>
      from pip import main
      ImportError: cannot import name main
   ```
  * Problem: Wrong version of _pip_ (are using Python 3 _pip_)
  * Solution: Run commands with _pip2_

3. ```python
   AttributeError: 'Graph' object has no attribute 'nodes_iter' (or other graph issues)
   ```
  * Problem: Wrong version of _networkx_ installed
  * Solution: Uninstall _networkx_ and install _networkx1.11_ (see above)
