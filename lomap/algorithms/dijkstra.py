	"""
	Compute the shortest path lengths between two sets of nodes in a weighted graph.
	Adapted from 'single_source_dijkstra_path_length' in NetworkX, available at
	http://networkx.github.io.

	Parameters
	----------
	G: NetworkX graph

	source_set: Set of node labels
		Starting nodes for paths

	target_set: Set of node labels
		Ending nodes for paths

	combine_fn: Function, optional (default: (lambda a,b: a+b))
		Function used to combine two path values

	degen_paths: Boolean, optional (default: False)
		Controls whether degenerate paths (paths that do not traverse any edges)
		are acceptable.

	weight_key: String, optional (default: 'weight')
		Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.

	Returns
	-------
	length : dictionary
		Dictionary of dictionaries of shortest lengths keyed by source and
		target labels.

	Notes
	-----
	Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
	This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
	are negative or are floating point numbers
	(overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).
	Input is assumed to be a MultiDiGraph with singleton edges.
